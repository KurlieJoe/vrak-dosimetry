#summary Logical Flow Chart of a VRAK call

= Introduction =

Running this software requires two command-line calls:
  * Elastix Registration
  * VRAK command

Elastix takes care of registering images and essentially converting to aligned numerical arrays (really the bulk of the hard work)
VRAK processes the image arrays and integrates the number of disintigrations for each voxel:
  * Open image data as numpy matrices
  * zero 'low-activity' voxels
  * decay-correct based on time post-injection and physical halflife
  * iterate through volume with curve fitting routine
  * integrate # of decays based on physical half-life
  * write output image volume (& optionally kinetics array)

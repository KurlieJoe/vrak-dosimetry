#Overview of Kinetics Fitting

= Introduction =

VRAK imports serial functional images as matrices and iterates through image volumes voxel-by-voxel with a 2- or 3-phase exponential pharmacokinetic curve fitting routine. 


= Details =

# Images are decay-corrected to yield a measure of biological concentration (proportional to percent injected dose) per voxel. Decay correction factors must be supplied in the input text file [image time post-injection, physical half-life].

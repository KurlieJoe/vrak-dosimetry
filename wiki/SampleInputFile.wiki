#Sample Text file used for VRAK input

= Introduction =

VRAK input files are read as lines of python code. Stylistically this is asking for a variable to be defined and assigned as a string.
Example:
{{{
image1='/path/to/image1.mhd'
}}}
This is where the user will define the path to input and output files along with the image time (in hours post-injection)
